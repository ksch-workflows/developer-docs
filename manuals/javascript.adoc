== Tools

In this project, the JavaScript tests are implemented with the tool QUnit.

== Execute tests in browser

The tests can be executed in the browser, just by opening the respective HTML page.

== Execute tests headless

A release can only be created when all tests pass.
In order to determine this automatically, there needs to be also a way to execute the tests automatically.
This can be done with the help of Grunt.
